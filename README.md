# Realm

Realm is a distributed, **event–based tasking runtime** for building high-performance applications that span clusters of CPUs, GPUs, and other accelerators.  
It began life as the low-level substrate underneath the [Legion](https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion) programming system but is now maintained as a standalone project for developers who want direct, fine-grained control of parallel and heterogeneous machines.

---

## Why Realm?

* **Asynchronous tasks & events** – Compose applications out of many light-weight tasks connected by events instead of blocking synchronization.
* **Heterogeneous execution** – Target CPUs, NVIDIA CUDA/HIP GPUs, OpenMP threads, and specialized fabrics with a single API.
* **Scalable networking** – Integrate GASNet-EX, UCX, MPI or shared memory transports for efficient inter-node communication.
* **Extensible modules** – Enable/disable features (CUDA, HIP, LLVM JIT, NVTX, PAPI …) at build time with simple CMake flags.
* **Portable performance** – Realm applications routinely scale from laptops to the world's largest supercomputers.

The runtime follows a *data-flow* execution model: tasks are launched asynchronously and start when their pre-condition events trigger. This design hides network and device latency, maximizes overlap, and gives programmers explicit control over when work becomes runnable.

For a deeper dive see the Realm white-paper published at PACT 2014:  
https://cs.stanford.edu/~sjt/pubs/pact14.pdf

## Quick start

### 1. Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/StanfordLegion/realm.git
cd realm
```

### 2. Build with CMake (recommended)
```bash
# Create an out-of-tree build directory
mkdir build && cd build
# Configure – pick the options that match your system
cmake .. \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DREALM_ENABLE_OPENMP=ON \   # OpenMP support
      -DREALM_ENABLE_CUDA=OFF       # flip ON to target NVIDIA GPUs

# Compile everything
make -j$(nproc)

# (optional) run the unit tests
ctest --output-on-failure
```
The full list of CMake toggles is documented inside [`CMakeLists.txt`](CMakeLists.txt).  Common switches include:

| Option | Default | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- | ------- |
| `REALM_ENABLE_CUDA` | `ON`  | Build CUDA backend |
| `REALM_ENABLE_HIP`  | `ON`  | Build HIP/ROCm backend |
| `REALM_ENABLE_GASNETEX` | `ON on Linux` | GASNet-EX network |
| `REALM_ENABLE_UCX` | `ON on Linux` | UCX network |
| `REALM_ENABLE_MPI` | `OFF` | MPI network |
| `REALM_LOG_LEVEL`  | `WARNING` | Compile-time log level |

> **TIP:** combine `cmake -LAH` or `ccmake` to explore every option.

### 3. Install (optional)
```bash
make install   # honour DESTDIR / CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX as usual
```
Libraries, headers and CMake packages will be placed under `include/realm`, `lib/`, and `share/realm/` so that external projects can consume Realm via
```cmake
find_package(Realm REQUIRED)
```

### 4. Try the tutorials
The easiest way to get started is to build the tutorials as part of your normal CMake build tree:

```bash
# Configure (enable tutorials) if you did not already
cmake -B build -DREALM_BUILD_TUTORIALS=ON
cmake --build build --target realm_hello_world

# Run it (path will be inside the build directory)
./build/tutorials/hello_world/realm_hello_world -ll:cpu 4
```

If you have **installed** Realm (e.g. via `make install`) you can also build an individual tutorial stand-alone:

```bash
cd tutorials/hello_world         # Inside this repo or the copy installed under share/realm/tutorials
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/realm/install
cmake --build build
./build/realm_hello_world -ll:cpu 4
```

> Note • The tutorial directories only provide CMake build files. Traditional Makefiles are no longer shipped.

**Tutorials currently available**

* Hello World – minimal Realm program
* Events & Barriers – synchronization primitive
* Reservations - locks
* Reductions
* CUDA/HIP interoperability – calling GPU kernels from Realm tasks
* Profiling & Tracing – using `-lg:prof` and Legion Prof
* Machine Model Exploration – querying the machine model
* Index Space Operations – set algebra helpers for index spaces
* Region Instances – creating and using regional instances
* Copy ⁄ Fill – DMA-style data movement between instances
* Subgraph Launches – launching groups of tasks together
* Deferred Allocation – lazy allocation of physical memory
* Completion Queues – querying event completion programmatically

## Runtime command-line flags
Realm and its modules share a common set of `-ll:<flag>` options to tune processor/memory counts at runtime:

```
-ll:cpu <N>      # number of CPU cores per rank
-ll:gpu <N>      # number of GPUs per rank
-ll:util <N>     # number of util processors (communication helpers)
-ll:csize <MB>   # DRAM memory per rank
-ll:fsize <MB>   # framebuffer memory per GPU
-ll:zsize <MB>   # zero-copy (pinned) memory per GPU
-logfile <path>  # redirect logging (supports % for rank)
-level <cat>=<n> # change logging level per category
```
Run any Realm executable with `-hl:help` (high-level) or `-ll:help` (low-level) to see everything that is available.
